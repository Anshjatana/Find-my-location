React App Description:
- Created a React app with two main components: PostalCodeInput for entering the country code (e.g., "in" for India) and LocationDisplay for presenting the fetched results.
- Implemented functionality where users can input the country code and trigger a search to fetch and displayed location information from a provided API.
- Displayed the API response data on the UI with appropriate structure and formatted information.
- Handled scenarios for API failures and incorrect user inputs to provide users with clear error messages and feedback.
- Included a loader to indicate the process of data retrieval while the API call is in progress. Also, added an icon to clear the displayed information on the UI.
- Utilized Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, employing actions and reducers to manage and update application state seamlessly.
- Incorporated media queries to ensure a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- Hosted the developed application on Netlify, providing a live demo link to access and explore the project. Also, pushed the code to a GitHub repository, allowing for review, collaboration, and version control.
